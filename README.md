### Advanced react best practices
    folder and file structure
    hooks and refs
improve security by using environment variables 
create user interfaces using material UI
work with google API
fetching data from unlimited resources using RapidAPI
    openweather and travel advisor APIs





Initialize a react app

```
npx create-react-app ./
```

once done, clean up the files. Delete the src folder and create a new empty one
each react application requires an index.js file in the src folder

in index.js
make the necessary imports
for every react application we have to mount our application onto the root div

create APP.js in src folder - it will be the most important component

install the necessary dependencies througout the process 
```
npm install @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @material-ui/lab @react-google-maps/api axios google-map-react

```
